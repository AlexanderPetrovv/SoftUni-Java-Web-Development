## Module Structure
### Java Web Development Basics
This course is an introduction to basic web development principles such as HTTP protocol, sessions and ways of preserving the state, data caching, various data protocols, and security of applications.

Part of the course is creating our own MVC framework based on Java and MySQL, splitting models, views and controllers, with front-controller and router, supporting all the basic functionalities needed for a modern web application: data visualization, tables, CRUD operations data, forms, paging, validation, notifications, users, sessions, login / logout, and more. In practice, learning to create own Java and MySQL web applications and understanding how web applications work as a structure and how MVC (model-view-controller) technology works in modern web applications.

This basic Java web development course sets out the basics of important principles needed for the next Java Web courses and the technologies they use to be studied.

The Java development lessons lay the foundations of working with Java databases, making it easier to use them in real-world applications and understanding concepts such as database transformation into object-oriented (ORM) modeling.


### Java MVC Frameworks - Spring
The Spring MVC course is focused on building advanced Java web applications with Model-View-Controller architecture using HTML5, databases, Hibernate / Spring Data and other Java technologies. The Spring Platform technology platform, its components and architecture, the creation of MVC web applications, the definition of models, views and partial views with the Thymeleaf / JSP view engine, the definition of controllers, the operation of databases and integration with Hibernate, Spring Data and MySQL. The course also includes more complex themes from Java Web Design with the Spring Framework, such as user experience, roles and sessions, using AJAX, caching, web application security, and working with libraries from MVC controls. Several practical laboratory exercises (labs) and workshops are being built to build comprehensive, full-featured Spring MVC web applications with Java, Hibernate, and MySQL. The course includes work on a team project to build a Java web application and ends with a practical web development exam with Spring MVC.
